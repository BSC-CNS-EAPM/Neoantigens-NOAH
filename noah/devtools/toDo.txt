## Things to do:

1. Fix typos. All the documentation written has not been proofread so there will be a lot of typos
2. Add more documentation to the code
3. Add a list of HLA ids that should be known without requiring the user to load them
4. Remove the feature to analyze HLAs based on a substring, or alternatively improve it.
5. Use a correction for the multitesting performed on the peptides of different length than the model.
6. Create a setup.py, rewrite the readme and write a documentation
7. create a folder with the scripts used to create the plots for the paper
8. extensively test that everything works
